# aws-in-a-box

This project is an emulator for several AWS services, à la Localstack. README in progress!

Currently supported services (see below for full support details):
- [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) - highly experimental, only enough for Kinesis Client Library to work. Not recommended to use!
- [Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)
- [KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)
- [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html)
- [SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)

Aws-in-a-box runs on HTTP (not HTTPS) but supports HTTP2 upgrade with h2c (HTTP without TLS).

## Why use this over localstack?
- High-performance; no overhead from docker or proxies
- Single statically-linked 7MB native binary. No interpereter/runtime hell. (There are also 3MB compressed [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/dzbarsky/aws-in-a-box/tags) if you prefer)
- Simple persistence scheme using atomic file writes. When using the native binary, no more broken persistent docker volumes

## Usage
The easiest way to consume this project is from pre-built artifacts on the release page or the docker image.
You can also build from source with either go native tooling or with Bazel, see Development section.

```
  -addr string
    	Address to run on (default "localhost:4569")
  -reuse-port
      If set, will apply the SO_REUSEPORT socket option on Darwin/Linux platforms.
  -enableKMS
    	Enable KMS service (default true)
  -enableKinesis
    	Enable Kinesis service (default true)
  -enableSQS
    	Enable SQS service (default true)
  -enableS3
      Enable S3 service (default true)
  -experimental_enableDynamoDB
    	Enable DynamoDB service (default true)
  -kinesisDefaultDuration duration
    	How long to retain messages. Can be used to control memory usage. After creation, retention can be adjusted with [Increase/Decrease]StreamRetentionPeriod (default 24h0m0s)
  -kinesisInitialShardsPerStream int
    	How many shards to create for each stream listed in -kinesisInitialStreams (default 2)
  -kinesisInitialStreams string
    	Streams to create at startup. Example: stream1,stream2,stream3
  -kinesisStreamCreateDuration duration
    	How long a new Kinesis stream stays in CREATING status (default 5s)
  -kinesisStreamDeleteDuration duration
    	How long a deleted Kinesis stream stays in DELETING status (default 5s)
  -logLevel string
    	debug/info/warn/error (default "debug")
  -persistDir string
    	Directory to persist data to. If empty, data is not persisted.
  -s3InitialBuckets string
    	Buckets to create at startup. Example: bucket1,bucket2,bucket3
```

## Development
You can use either native go tooling or Bazel.

### Running the service
- `go run .`
- `bazel run //:aws-in-a-box`

### Running tests
- `go test ./...`
- `bazel test //...`

## Kinesis Support
Most of Kinesis is implemented, including the Consumer APIS. Remaining work:
- KMS integration not wired up
- A few List/Describe APIs are missing
- Shard split/merge

There is no persistence for Kinesis data.

## S3 Support
Most common operations of S3 are implemented. Remaining work:
- Versioning
- A bunch of metadata/usage APIs
- Policy/ACL is missing

S3 blocks are persisted, but metadata is not. This will be fixed in the future.
